<h3>ENGLISH AND AMERICAN REPRINTS OF OLD BOOKS</h3>
<p>Most people are aware of the great demand there is for English
literature, and indeed for all literature in the United States: for
some years the anxiety of persons in that part of the world to
obtain copies of our early printed books, prose, poetry, and plays,
has been well known to such as collect and sell them on this side
of the water. Where American purchasers could not obtain original
editions they have, in all possible cases, secured reprints, and
they have made some themselves.</p>
<p>Not very long since a present of a most creditable and
well-edited republication of "Four Old Plays" was sent to me from
Cambridge, U.S., consisting of "Three Interludes: <i>Thersytes</i>,
<i>Jack Jugler</i>, and Heywood's <i>Pardoner and Frere</i>; and
<i>Jocasta</i>, a tragedy by Gascoigne and Kinwelmarsh." They are
preceded by a very well written and intelligent, and at the same
time modest, Introduction, signed F.J.C., the initials of Mr.
Francis James Child; who in fact was kind enough to forward the
volume to me, and who, if I am not mistaken, was formerly a
correspondent of mine in a different part of the republic.</p>
<p>My particular reason for noticing the book is to impress upon
editors in this country the necessity of accuracy, not only for the
sake of readers and critics here, but for the sake of those abroad,
because Mr. Child's work illustrates especially the disadvantage of
the want of that accuracy. It so happens that two, if not three, of
the pieces included in the Cambridge volume, are absolutely unique,
and are now in the library of the Duke of Devonshire. They went
through my hands some years ago, and as they had been previously
reprinted in London (two of them for the Roxburghe Club), I took
the opportunity of collating my copies of them. The third
interlude, which was not reprinted for any society, but as a
private speculation, "by George Smeeton, in St. Martin's
Church-yard," is Heywood's <i>Pardoner and Frere</i>, the full
title of which is "<i>A mery playe betwene the pardoner, and the
frere, the curate and neybour Pratte</i>." The original copy has
the following imprint: "Imprynted by Wyllyam Rastell the v. day of
Apryll, the yere of our lorde, M. CCCCC. xxx III."</p>
<p>The reprint by Smeeton is in black letter, and it professes to
be a fac-simile, or as nearly so as possible; and although it
consists of only eight leaves, it contains no fewer than forty
variations from the original, all more or less important, and one
of them the total omission of a line, so that the preceding line is
left without its corresponding rhyme, and the sense materially
injured.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Mr. Child reprinted in America from this
defective reprint in England; but his sagacity prevented him from
falling into some of the blunders, although it could not supply him
with the wanting line; and his notes are extremely clear and
pertinent. I shall not go over the thirty-nine other errors; but I
shall just quote the passage as it stands in the (as far as I know)
unique copy, now deposited at Devonshire House, and supply in
italics the necessary line. It occurs in a speech by the Pardoner,
near the end, where he is praising one of his relics:&mdash;</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page210" id=
"page210"></a>{210}</span>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"I wyll edefy more, with the syght of it</p>
<p>Than wyll all the pratynge of holy wryt;</p>
<p>For that except that the precher, hym selfe lyue well,</p>
<p>His predycacyon wyll helpe neuer a dell,</p>
<p>And I know well, that thy lyuynge is nought:</p>
<p><i>Thou art an apostata, yf it were well sought</i>,</p>
<p>An homycyde thou art I know well inoughe," &amp;c.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The line omitted is the more remarkable, because it contains an
instance of the employment of a word very old in our language, and
in use in the best periods of our prose and poetry: "apostata" is
explained in the <i>Promptorium</i>, is found in Skelton and
Heywood, and so down to the time of Massinger, who was especially
fond of it.</p>
<p>How many copies were issued of Smeeton's reprint of <i>The
Pardoner and the Frere</i>, I know not; but any of your readers,
who chance to possess it, will do well to add the absent line in
the margin, so that the mistake may be both rectified and recorded.
I was not aware of Mr. Child's intention to re-publish the
interlude in the United States, or I would long ago have sent him
the correction, as indeed I did, a day or two after I received his
volume. It was, nevertheless, somewhat ungracious to thank him for
his book, and at the same time to point out an important error in
it, for which, however, he was in no way responsible.</p>

<hr />
<h3>CATACOMBS AND BONE-HOUSES.</h3>
<p>Without attempting to answer the queries of MR. GATTY, (No. 11.
p. 171.) I venture to send a note on the subject. I believe it will
generally be found that the local tradition makes such collections
of bones to be "the grisly gleanings of some battlefield." One of
the most noteworthy collections of this kind that I have seen is
contained in the crypt of Hythe Church, Kent, where a vast quantity
of bones are piled up with great regularity, and preserved with
much care. According to a written statement suspended in the crypt,
they are the relics of Britons and Saxons slain in a battle fought
on the beach in the sixth century; the local tradition is nearly to
the same effect, but of course is of little value, as it has most
likely arisen from or been conformed to this "written chronicle;"
both writing and tradition must indeed be regarded with distrust.
It is affirmed in the neighbourhood that the bones were <i>dug
up</i> from the beach; but I, at least, could hear of no tradition
as to the period when they were exhumed. Perhaps some resident will
ascertain whether any such exists.</p>
<p>The bones have all the appearance of considerable antiquity; yet
they are in excellent preservation. The skulls are remarkably white
and perfect, and are altogether a very curious collection,
differing greatly in size, form, and thickness. The holes and
fractures in many of them (made evidently during life) leave no
doubt that they belonged to persons who met with a violent
death.</p>
<p>I will not pretend to reply to the concluding queries of your
correspondent, but I would just remark that, from what we know of
the feeling of our ancestors respecting the remains of the dead, it
appears probably that if from any cause a large quantity of human
bones were found, or were from any cause obliged to be disturbed,
some ecclesiastic or pious layman would take measures to have them
removed to some consecrated spot where they might be safe from
further molestation. They would hardly be treated in any such
manner as Dr. Mantell states the bones removed by the railway
engineers from the Priory ground at Lewes were treated. I remain,
sir, your very obedient servant,</p>

<h3>LINES ATTRIBUTED TO HUDIBRAS.</h3>
<p>Perhaps the following extract from a volume entitled <i>The
Relics of Literature</i>, published by Boys and Co., Ludgate Hill,
1820, may prove interesting, as further illustrating the so
frequently disputed passage which forms the subject matter of your
first article in No. 12.:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Few popular quotations have more engaged the pens of critics
than the following:&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>'For he that fights and runs away</p>
<p>Will live to fight another day.'</p>
</div>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>"These lines are almost universally supposed to form a part of
<i>Hudibras</i>; and, so confident have even scholars been on the
subject, that in 1784 a wager was made at Bootle's, of twenty to
one, that they were to be found in that inimitable poem. Dodsley
was referred to as the arbitrator, when he ridiculed the idea of
consulting him on the subject, saying, 'Every fool knows they are
in <i>Hudibras</i>.' George Selwyn, who was present, said to
Dodsley, 'Pray, sir, will you be good enough, then, to inform an
old fool, who is at the same time your wise worship's very humble
servant, in what canto they are to be found?' Dodsley took down the
volume, but he could not find the passage; the next day came, with
no better success; and the sage bibliopole was obliged to confess,
'that a man might be ignorant of the author of this well-known
couplet without being absolutely a fool.'"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have also the following memorandum in a common-place book of
mine, but I do not remember from what source I transcribed it many
years past:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The couplet, thus erroneously ascribed to the author of
<i>Hudibras</i>, occurs in a small volume of Miscellaneous Poems,
by Sir John Mennis, written in the reign of Charles the Second,
which has now become extremely scarce. The original of the couplet
may, however, be traced to much higher authority, even to
Demosthenes, who has the following expression:&mdash;</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page211" id=
"page211"></a>{211}</span>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>'[Greek: Anaer ho pheugon kai palin machaesetai]',</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>of which the lines are almost a literal translation."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While on the subject of quotations, let me ask whether any of
your correspondents can tell me where the passage, "Providence
tempers the wind to the shorn lamb," is to be found?</p>
<p>Among a few of the many floating quotable passages universally
known, without any trace of the authors, among general readers and
writers, are the following:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"When wild in woods the noble savage ran."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>DRYDEN's <i>Conquest of Grenada</i>.</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"And whistled as he went for want of thought."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>DRYDEN's <i>Cymon and Iphigenia</i>.</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Great wits are sure to madness near allied,</p>
<p>And thin partitions do their bounds divide."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>DRYDEN's <i>Absalom and Achitophel</i>, st. i. I. 163.</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"The tenth transmitter of a foolish face."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>SAVAGE.</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"When Greek meets Greek then comes the tug of war."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>NAT. LEE.</p>
<p>The real line in Lee is&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"When Greeks join Greeks then was the tug of war."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>LEE's <i>Alexander the Great</i>.</p>
<p class="author">J.W.G. GUTCH</p>
<hr />
<p>I wish to ask a few questions, referring to these lines, if you
do not think the subject already exhausted by Mr. Rimbault's
curious and interesting communication.</p>
<p>1. Does not the <i>entire</i> quotation run somewhat
thus:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"For he that fights and runs away</p>
<p>May live to fight another day;</p>
<p>But he that is in battle slain</p>
<p>Can never hope to fight again"?</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>2. Are the two last lines in the <i>Musarum
Delici&aelig;</i>?</p>
<p>3. May not the idea suggesting the two first lines be traced to
some passage in one of the orations of <i>Demosthenes</i>, and,
PAST him, to the "[Greek: Anaer ho pheugon kai palin machaesetai]"
of some contemporary, if not still older writer?</p>
<p>4. Whose <i>Apothegems</i> [qy., those of Demosthenes?] are
under consideration on folio 239., from which Mr. Rimbault
quotes?</p>
<p>Queries 1, 2, 3 have long stood <i>in MS.</i> in my note-book,
and I should much like to see them in <i>print</i>, while the
subject to which they refer is still fresh in the minds of your
readers.</p>
<p class="author">MELANION</p>
<hr />
<p>The lines&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"For he that fights and runs away</p>
<p>May live to fight another day,"</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>resemble the following quatrain in the <i>Satyre
Menipp&eacute;e</i>, being one of the several verses appended to
the tapestry on which was wrought the battle of Senlis:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Souvent celuy qui demeure</p>
<p>Est cause de son meschef;</p>
<p>Celuy qui fuit de bonne heure</p>
<p>Peut combattre de rechef."</p>

<h3>NOTES FROM FLY-LEAVES, No. 5.</h3>
<p>In the library of St. John's College are some hundreds of
volumes bequeathed to it by Thomas Baker; most of these have little
notices on the fly-leaves, some thirty or forty of which seem worth
printing. One (Strype's <i>Life of Parker</i>) has marginal notes
throughout the book, the value of which will be duly appreciated by
those who have read Baker's notes on Burnet's <i>Reformation</i>.
(See the <i>British Magazine</i> for the last year.)</p>
<p>Hereafter, if you do not object, I hope to send larger extracts
from Baker's MSS.; at present I confine myself to a single
specimen, taken from the fly-leaf of a copy of Noy's <i>Compleat
Lawyer</i>, London, 1665. (St. John's Library, Class mark, I. 10.
49)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Gul. Noye de S. Buriens. Com. Cornub. Armig. unus Magistrorum
de Banco fieri fecit, 1626. On a window in Lincoln Inn's Chapell.
See Stow's <i>Survey</i>, &amp;c. vol. ii. lib. ii. p. 73.</p>
<p>"This book has a former edition, London, 1661; but not so fair a
print, and without the Author's Life.</p>
<p>"See Fuller's <i>Worthies in Cornwall</i>, p. 200.</p>
<p>"See Mr. Gerard's Letter to Lord Strafford, dated Jan 3. 1634.
<i>Mr. Noy continues ill, &amp; is retired to his house at
Brentford: I saw him much fallen away in his Face &amp; Body, but
as yellow as Gold&mdash;with the Jaundice&mdash;his bloody waters
continue with drain his Body.</i></p>
<p>"See Lloyd's <i>State Worthies</i>, p. 892, 893. &amp;c.</p>
<p>"Aug. 9. [1634] Wm Noy Esquire the King's Attorney died at
Brainford.&mdash;Mr. Ric. Smith's <i>Obituary</i>.</p>
<p>"See Wm Noy's Will (very remarkable) MS. vol. xxx. p. 309.</p>
<p>"16th Dec. 1631. Conc. Ornatissimo viro Gulielmo Noye, ut sit de
Consilio Universitatis&mdash;et annuatim 40th recipiat,
&amp;c.&mdash;Regr. Acad Cant.</p>
<p>"See Howell's Letters, sect 6. pp. 30, 31.</p>
<p>"Rex 27. October. 1632 constituit Willielmum Noye Arm.
Attornatum suum Generalem, durante beneplacito.&mdash;Rymer, tom.
19. p. 347.</p>
<p>"See his (W.N.) will, very pious except the last clause, which
is next to impious. vol. xxxvi. MS. p. 379.</p>
<p>"Young Noy, the dissipanding Noy, is kill'd in France in a
Duell, by a Brother of St. John Biron; so now the younger Brother
is Heir and Ward to the King.&mdash;A Letter to Lord Deputy
Wentworth, vol. ii. p. 2 dat. Apr. 5. 1636."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It may be as well to add, that the references to vols. xxx. and
xxxvi. of MS. are to two different copies of the will in two
volumes of Baker's MSS., in the University library. The word
"dissipanding," in the last quotation, doubtless is an allusion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page212" id=
"page212"></a>{212}</span> to "dissipanda" in the will itself. I
once had occasion to take a copy of this will, and found the
variations between the two copies trifling.</p>

<h3>THE PURSUITS OF LITERATURE.</h3>
<p>Many years ago, the satirical poem, entitled <i>The Pursuits of
Literature</i>, engaged public attention for a very considerable
time; the author concealed his name; and from 1796 at least to
1800, the world continued guessing at who could be the author.
Amongst the names to which the poem was ascribed were those of
Anstey, Colman, Jun., Coombe, Cumberland, Harry Dampier, Goodall,
Hudderford, Knapp, MATHIAS, Mansell, Wrangham, Stephen Weston, and
many others, chiefly Etonians. George Steevens, it is believed,
fixed upon the real author at an early period: at least in the
<i>St. James's Chronicle</i>, from Tuesday, May 1. to Thursday, May
3. 1798, we find&mdash;</p>

<h2>QUERIES.</h2>
<h3>BARRYANA.</h3>
<p>The inquiries of "DRAMATICUS," and others in your number for
Nov. 10., prompt me to say that should any of your correspondents
happen to possess information answering the following queries, or
any of them, I shall be thankful to share it.</p>
<p>1. What became of the natural child of Elizabeth Barry, the
actress, who died 1713; and whether the Earl of Rochester, its
father, was really Wilmot (as Galt assumes) or Hyde, on whom that
title was conferred at Wilmot's death? The former mentions a
natural daughter in his last will; but he names it "Elizabeth
Clerke," and does not allude to its mother. Mrs. Barry's will
mentions no kindred whatever. But Galt describes her as daughter of
Edward Barry, Esq., a barrister of Charles I.'s reign.&mdash;Who
was he? Spranger Barry, the actor of fifty years later, Sir William
Betham and myself have succeeded in connecting satisfactorily, and
legitimately, with the noble house of Barry, Lord Santry; but I
cannot as yet show that Mrs. E. Barry inherited her theatrical
talent from an identical source.</p>
<p>2. Of what family was Mr. Barry, the Secretary to the Equivalent
Company, who died about 1738? I possess immense collections on the
name of Barry, but I cannot identify any London will or
administration as this individual's.</p>
<p>3. Whether Sir Robert Walpole's Secret Government Lists of the
Pretender's adherents, agents, and emissaries in London (who were
supposed to be under the evil-eye of Jonathan Wild) still exist,
and are accessible?</p>
<p class="author">WILLIAM D'OYLY BAYLEY.</p>
<p>Coatham, Yorkshire, Jan. 1849-50.</p>
<hr />
<h3>NINE QUERIES.</h3>
<p>1. <i>Book-plate.</i>&mdash;Whose was the book-plate with the
following device:&mdash;An eagle or vulture feeding with a snake
another bird nearly as large as herself; a landscape, with the sea,
&amp;c. in the distance: very meanly engraved, in an oval,
compassed with the motto, "Pietas homini tutissima virtus"?</p>
<p>2. <i>Addison's Books.</i>&mdash;I have two or three volumes,
bound apparently at the beginning of <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page213" id="page213"></a>{213}</span> the last century, with a
stamp on the cover, consisting of J.A., in a cursive character,
within a small circle. Was this the book-stamp of Joseph
Addison?</p>
<p>3. <i>Viridis Vallis.</i>&mdash;Where was the monastery of
"Viridis Vallis," and what is its vernacular name?</p>
<p>4. <i>Cosmopoli.</i>&mdash;Has <i>Cosmopoli</i> been ever
appropriated to any known locality? Archdeacon Cotton mentions it
among the pseudonymes in his <i>Typographical Gazetteer</i>. The
work whose real locality I wish to ascertain is, <i>Sandii
Paradox</i>. iv. <i>Evang.</i> 1670. 1 vol. 8vo.</p>
<p>5. <i>Seriopoli.</i>&mdash;The same information is wanting
respecting "Seriopoli; apud Entrapelios Impensis Catonis
Uticensis:" which occurs in the title-page of "Seria de Jocis," one
of the tracts connected with the Bollandist controversy.</p>
<p>6. <i>Early Edition of the Vulgate.</i>&mdash;Where is there any
critical notice of a very beautiful edition of the Vultage, small
4to., entitled "Sacra Biblia, cum studiis ac diligentia emendata;"
in the colophon, "Venetiis, apud Jolitos, 1588"? The preface is by
"Johannes Jolitus de Ferrar&uuml;s." The book is full of curious
wood-cuts. This is not the book mentioned in Masch's <i>Le Long</i>
(part ii, p. 229), though that was also printed by the Gioliti in
1588; as the title of the latter book is "Biblia ad vetustissima
Exemplaria castigata," and the preface is by Hentenius.</p>
<p>7. <i>Identity of Anonymous Annotators.</i>&mdash;Can any of the
correspondents of "NOTES AND QUERIES" point out to a literary
Backwoodsman, like myself, any royal road towards assigning to the
proper authors the handwriting of anonymous annotations in
fly-leaves and margins? I have many of these, which I should be
glad to ascertain.</p>
<p>8. <i>Complutensian Polyglot.</i>&mdash;In what review or
periodical did there appear, some time ago, a notice of the
supposed discovery (or of conjectures as to the existence) of the
MSS. from which the "Complutensian Polyglot" was compiled,
involving, of course, the repudiation of the common story of the
rocket maker of Alcala? Has any further light been thrown on this
subject?</p>
<p>9. <i>Blunder in Malone's Shakspeare.</i>&mdash;Has any notice
been taken of the following odd blunder in Malone's
<i>Shakspeare</i>, Dublin ed. 1794?</p>
<p>In vol. ii. p. 138, the editor, speaking of <i>John</i>
Shakspeare's will (the father of William), says "This extraordinary
will consisted of fourteen articles, <i>but the first leaf being
unluckily wanting</i>, I am unable to ascertain either its date, or
the particular occasion on which it was written." He then gives a
copy of the will, beginning at the third article, in the middle of
a sentence, thus: "... at least spiritually." Now, in the first
vol. p. 154. is a document, professing to be William Shakspeare's
will. But of this the first three paragraphs belong to John
Shakspeare's will, his name being mentioned in each: and the third
concludes with the words "at least spiritually." The fourth
paragraph, to the end, belongs to William Shakspeare's will, as
given in Johnson and Stevens's editions. This is a palpable
instance of editorial carelessness: Mr. Malone had mixed the two
documents, mislaid the first portion of the transcript of William
Shakspeare's will, and then neglected to examine the postscript, or
he must have found out his mistake.</p>
<p>Was this error acknowledged or corrected in any subsequent
edition?</p>
<p class="author">JOHN JEBB.</p>
<hr />
<h3>MINOR QUERIES</h3>
<p><i>Mowbray Coheirs.</i>&mdash;Collins in his <i>Peerage</i> (ed.
Brydges, 1812), says, at p. 18., speaking of Thomas Duke of
Norfolk:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In 15 Henry VII, he made partition with Maurice, surviving
brother of William Marquiss of Berkeley (who died issueless), of
the lands that came to them by inheritance, by right of their
descent, from the coheirs of <i>Mowbray</i>, Duke of Norfolk;"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and quotes, as his authority, <i>Commun. de T. Pasch, 15 Henry
VII., Rot.</i> 1.</p>
<p>The roll of the whole year referred to has been examined,
without finding any notice of the subject.</p>
<p>Should any of your readers have met with the statement
elsewhere, it may happen that there is some error in Collins's
reference to his authority; and a clue to the right roll, or any
other notice of the division of this great inheritance, will be
acceptable.</p>
<p class="author">G.</p>
<p><i>Draytone and Yong.</i>&mdash;The following note was found by
me among the Exchequer Records, on their sale and dispersion, a few
years ago:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I praye you fellowe Draytone do so invehe for me as to Resave
all svche moneye as is dewe to me from the handes of Ser Vincente
Skyner Knyghte or else wheare from thos offysers of the excheqer
And this shalbe yovr discharge. Written the laste daye of Janvarye
1607. Henry Yong."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Can your subscribers inform me who the writer was? Mr. Payne
Collier states that there was an interlude-maker of the name of
Henry Yong in the reign of Henry VIII. Is it likely that the note
was addressed to Michael Drayton?</p>
<p class="author">ROBT. COLE.</p>
<p>Upper Norton Street, Jan. 23, 1850.</p>
<p><i>The Fraternity of Christian Doctrine.</i>&mdash;I think I see
some names among your correspondents who might inform me where I
shall find the fullest account of the Fraternity of Christian
Doctrine, established by St. Charles Borromeo in the diocese of
Milan. I am acquainted with the regulations for their establishment
in <i>Acta. Concil. Mediol.</i>, and with the incidental notices of
them which <span class="pagenum"><a name="page214" id=
"page214"></a>{214}</span> occur in Borromeo's writings, as also in
the later authors, Bishop Burnet, Alban Butler, and Bishop Wilson
(of Calcutta). The numbers of the Sunday schools under the
management of the Confraternity, the number of teachers, of
scholars, the books employed, the occasional rank in life of the
teachers, their method of teaching, and whether any manuals have
ever been compiled for their guidance&mdash;are points upon which I
would gladly gather any information.</p>
<p class="author">C.F.S.</p>
<p><i>Treatise by Englebert, Archbishop of Treves.</i>&mdash;Bishop
Cosin (in his <i>Hist. Trans.</i> cap. vii. &sect;12) refers to
<i>Engelb. Archiep. Trevirensis, ap. Goldasti Imper.</i> tom. i. In
Goldast's <i>Politica Imperialia</i> there is a treatise by S.
Engelb. Abb. <i>Admoutens</i> in Austria: but I find neither the
author referred to, nor the treatise intended, by Cosin. According
to Eisengrein, who is followed by Possivinus, there were <i>two</i>
Engelberts; viz. Engelbertus, S. Matthi&aelig; <i>Treverensis</i>,
Benedictin&aelig; possessionis Abbus, patria <i>Mosellanus</i>, who
lived A.D. 987; and S. Engelbert, who flourished A.D. 1157, and who
is described as <i>Admontensis</i> Benedictin&aelig; posessionis
Abbus, <i>Germanus</i>. Can any of your correspondents kindly
direct me to the intended treatise of the Archbishop of Treves?</p>
<p class="author">J. SANSOM.</p>
<p>Oxford, Jan. 9. 1850.</p>
<p><i>New Year's Day Custom.</i>&mdash;I shall be glad if any of
your readers can inform me of the origin and signification, of the
custom of carrying about decorated apples on New Year's Day, and
presenting them to the friends of the bearers. The apples have
three skewers of wood stuck into them so as to form a tripod
foundation, and their sides are ornamented with oat grains, while
various evergreens and berries adorn the top. A raisin is
occasionally fastened on each oat grain, but this is, I believe,
and innovation.</p>
<p class="author">SELEUCUS.</p>
<p><i>Under the Rose.</i>&mdash;That the English proverbial
expression, <i>Under the Rose</i>, is derived from the
confessional, is, I believe, generally admitted: but the authorship
of the well-known Latin verses on this subject is still, as far as
I am aware, a <i>rexata qu&aelig;stio</i>, and gives a somewhat
different and <i>tantaleau</i><a id="footnotetag1" name=
"footnotetag1"></a><a href="#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a> meaning to
the adage:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">

<p><i>Norman Pedigrees.</i>&mdash;Can any gentleman inform me where
(in what book) may be found the situation of the places from which
the companions of William the Norman took their names? Such
<i>French</i> names as have <i>De</i> prefixed&mdash;in fact, a
<i>Gazetteer</i>? Also, where may be found&mdash;if such
exist&mdash;pedigrees of the same <i>worthies</i>?</p>
<p class="author">B.</p>
<p><i>Dr. Johnson's library.</i>&mdash;I have long wanted to know
what became of the library of Dr. Samuel Johnson (of our city), or
if he had any considerable collection of books. Perhaps some of
your correspondents would answer both these queries. I happen to
have a few, some of which were used in compiling his Dictionary,
and are full of his marks, with references to the quotations, most
of which are to be found in the Dictionary. I have also his own
Prayer-Book.</p>
<p class="author">T.G. LOMAX.</p>
<p>Lichfield, Jan. 11. 1850.</p>
<p><i>Golden Frog.</i>&mdash;In the church of Boxstead, in the
county of Suffolk, there is a large and very handsome monument of
marble, in a niche of which stands, in full proportion, a man in
armour, his head bare, with moustaches and a tuft on his chin; in
his right hand he holds a truncheon, and by his side is his sword;
his armour is garnished with gold studs, and his helmet stands on
the ground behind him; from his right ear hangs a <i>gold
frog</i>.</p>
<p>This monument was erected in memory of Sir John Poley, of
Wrongay, in Norfolk, knight, who died in 1638, at the age of
upwards of eighty, having served much abroad under Henry IV. of
France, Christian King of Denmark, &amp;c., and in Queen
Elizabeth's service against the Spaniards.</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Illius ante alios cepit cum dextera Gades</p>
<p>Militis Angliaci, et fulmina sensit Iberis."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>I send you this detail, in hopes that some of your
correspondents may be able to explain the ornament in his ear,
whether it be the badge of any order, and whether any other
instance is known of its use. There is in Boxstead Hall, the seat
of the very ancient family of Poley, a portrait of Sir John having
the same ornament.</p>

<p><i>Singular Motto.</i>&mdash;Being at Cheltenham in the summer
of 1811, I saw a chariot standing in an inn yard, on the panels of
which, under a coat of arms, apparently belonging to some foreign
family, was the following on a scroll, in the nature of a
motto:&mdash;"oemn3&mdash;ononoe.7 ano&mdash;7 emn3." If any of
your correspondents can inform me what is its meaning, and if it be
a motto, to what family it belongs, he will oblige.</p>

<p><i>Sir Stephen Fox.</i>&mdash;Will any of your intelligent
correspondents inform me whether Sir Stephen Fox, the ancestor of
the present Lord Holland and the Earl of Ilchester, had any
brothers or sisters, and if so, whether they had any children, and
who are the legal representatives of those collateral branches, if
any?</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page215" id=

<p><i>Antony Alsop.</i>&mdash;Will any of your correspondents
kindly tell me who Antony Alsop was? A thin Quarto volume of Latin
Odes was published in 1753, with the following title: "Antonii
Alsopi &AElig;dis Christi olim Alumni Ordarum Libri Duo," Londoni,
1753. They are extremely elegant, and deserving the attention of
all lovers of Latin poetry. I have also another volume, "Latin and
English Poems, by a Gentleman of Trinity College, Oxford," Quarto
London, 1738. In this latter volume, with but two or three
exceptions, the poems are very obscene, yet I find one or two of
Alsop's odes in it. Could any of your readers tell me if both
volumes are by the same author? Was Alsop at Trinity College and
subsequently a student of Christ Church?</p>

word, which is to be found in a leading article of <i>The

also possessed one. These two, and another in the hands of a friend

<p><i>Tomlinson, of Southwingfield, Derbyshire.</i>&mdash;The
parochial register of the parish of Southwingfield, in the county
of Derby, contains, among its earliest entries (A.D. 1586), the
name Tomlinson, as then resident therein. The family, to the
present time, continues to reside within the parish, as respectable
yeomen, and has thence extended itself to many of the neighbouring
parishes, as well as to more distinct localities. Blore's
<i>History of Southwingfield</i> makes no mention of such a family
connected with the parish, as tenants or otherwise; nor does it
appear that there is at present any family of Tomlinson bearing
arms that can have been derived from any of the ancient lords of
Wingfield. The wills at Lichfield, to whose registry Southwingfield
belongs, are in a very dilapidated and unsatisfactory state, at the
time immediately preceding the commencement of the Southwingfield
parochial register. Probably some genealogist will be enabled to
offer a suggestion as to the means which are available for tracing
the genealogy of this fanily prior to the year 1586.</p>
<p><i>The Phrase "To have a Button in the Room," and
"Sally."</i>&mdash;I have again been reading that most amusing
book, <i>The Lives of the Norths</i>. At p. 88 of vol. i. (edit.
1826) there is a passage which has always puzzled me. Speaking of
some law proceedings in which the Lady Dacres was concerned, Roger
North says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"And herein she served herself another way, for her adversary
defamed her for swearing and unswearing, and it was not amiss to
<i>have a button in the room</i>."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At p. 92. (<i>post</i>) there is another strange expression:
&mdash;</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page216" id=
"page216"></a>{216}</span>
<blockquote>
<p>"The horse, when he found himself clear of pursuers, stopped his
course by degrees, and went with his rider (fast asleep upon his
back) into a pond to drink, and there sat his lordship upon the
'<i>sally</i>.' (Qy. <i>saddle</i>?)"</p>

house of the apostles Philip and James the son of
Alpheus."&mdash;<i>Early Travels in Palestine (Mandeville)</i>, p.
175.; Bohn's <i>Antiquarian Library</i>. This is the only place,
except in the Church service, where I have seen the above-named
apostles coupled together, and have often wondered whether there
was any old legend or tradition to account for the Church joining
them together in one commemorative festival.</p>

<p><i>Sir William Hamilton.</i>&mdash;On a tombstone in the
burial-ground at St. Hilda's, South Shields, in the county of
Durham, is the following inscription:&mdash;</p>

Maria ye late Queene mother of our Soveraigne Lord King Charles

June 24th anno Domni 1681."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is in the possession of an old lady living at Durham, in
1836, an original note in the handwriting of King Charles the
Second, of which the following is a copy:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Whereas a debte of foure thousande one hundred and fifty pounds

<p><i>Devices on Standards of the Anglo-Saxons.</i>&mdash;Can any
of your readers inform me what devices were borne on the standards
of the several Anglo-Saxon kingdoms during the so-called Heptarchy?
The <i>white horse</i> is by many supposed to have been the
standard of Wessex, and to have been borne by Alfred; but was not
this really the ensign of the Jutish kingdom of Kent, the county of
Kent to this day displaying the white horse in its armorial
bearings? The standard of Wessex is by others said to have been the
<i>white dragon</i>; but Thierry supposes that this, like the
contrasted <i>red dragon</i> of Cymbri, was merely a poetical
designation, and seems to infer that the flags of these two
contending people were without any device. Again, it has been
thought that a <i>lion</i> was the ensign of Northumbria; in which
case we may, perhaps, conclude that the lions which now grace the
shield of the city of York have descended from Anglo-Saxon times.
The memory of the Danish standard of the <i>Raven</i>, described by
Asser and other Anglo-Saxon chroniclers, still remains; but
whether, when Northumbria and East Anglia fell under Danish power,
this device supplanted previous Anglo-Saxon devices, is a curious
question for antiquarian research. The famous Norwegian
standard&mdash;the Landeyda, or ravager of the world&mdash;under
which Harold Hardrada triumphed at Fulford, near York, but to fall
a few days later at Stanford Bridge, is well known; but who can
inform us as to the device which it bore? These early traces of
heraldic usage appear to deserve more notice than I believe they
have received.</p>

<h2>REPLIES</h2>
<h3>THE FIELD OF FORTY FOOTSTEPS.</h3>
<p>The fields behind Montague House were, from about the year 1680,
until towards the end of the last century, the scenes of robbery,
murder, and every species of depravity and wickedness of which the
heart can think. They appear to have been originally called the
Long Fields, and afterwards (about Strype's time) the Southampton
Fields. These fields remained waste and useless, with the exception
of some nursery grounds near the New Road to the north, and a piece
of ground enclosed for the Toxophilite Society, towards the
northwest, near the back of Gower Street. The remainder was the
resort of depraved wretches, whose amusements consisted chiefly in
fighting pitched battles, and other disorderly sport, especially on
the Sabbath day. Such was their state in 1800.</p>
<p>Tradition had given to the superstitious at that period a
legendary story of the period of the Duke of Monmouth's Rebellion,
of two brothers who fought in this field so ferociously as to
destroy each other; since which, their footsteps, formed from the
vengeful struggle, were said to remain, with the indentations
produced by their advancing and receding; nor could any grass or
vegetable ever be produced where these <i>forty footsteps</i> were
thus displayed. This extraordinary arena was said to be at the
extreme termination of the northeast end of Upper Montague Street;
and, profiting by the fiction, Miss Porter and her sister produced
an ingenious romance thereon, entitled, <i>Coming Out, or the Forty
Footsteps</i>. The Messrs. Mayhew also, some twenty years back,
brought out, at the Tottenham Street Theatre, an excellent
melodrama piece, founded upon the same story, entitled <i>The Field
of Forty Footsteps</i>.</p>
<p>In 1792, an ingenious and enterprising architect, James Burton,
began to erect a number of houses on the Foundling Hospital estate,
partly in St. Giles's and Bloomsbury parishes, and partly in that
of St. Pancras. <i>Baltimore House</i>, built, towards the
northeast of <i>Bedford House</i>, by Lord Baltimore, in 1763,
appears to have been the only erection since Strype's survey to
this period, with the exception of a chimney-sweeper's cottage
still further north, and part of which is still to be seen in
Rhodes's Mews, Little Guildford Street. In 1800, Bedford House was
demolished entirely; which with its offices and gardens, had been
the site where the noble family of the Southamptons, and the
illustrious Russells, had resided during more than 200 years,
almost isolated. Hence commenced the formation of a fine uniform
street, Bedford Place, consisting of forty houses, on the spot;
also, the north side of Bloomsbury Square, Montague Street to the
west, and one side of Southampton Row to the east. Towards the
north, the extensive piece of waste ground, denominated the
<i>Southampton Fields</i>, was transformed into a magnificent
square, with streets diverging therefrom in various directions.
Thus, as if by "touch of magic wand," those scenes, which had been
"hideous" for centuries, became transformed into receptacles of
civil life and polished society.</p>
<p>The latest account of these <i>footsteps</i>, previous to their
being built over, with which I am acquainted, is the following,
extracted from one of Joseph Moser's <i>Common-place Books</i> in
my possession:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"June 16. 1800.&mdash;Went into the fields at the back of
Montague House, and there saw, for the last time, the <i>forty
footsteps</i>; the building materials are there ready to cover them
from the sight of man. I counted more than <i>forty</i>, but they
might be the foot-prints of the workmen."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This extract is valuable, as it establishes the period of the
final demolition of the footsteps, and also confirms the legend
that <i>forty</i> was the original number.</p>

<h3>QUERIES ANSWERED, NO. 4.&mdash;"POKERSHIP", BY BOLTON
CORNEY.</h3>
<p>A query made by so experienced a writer as the noble historian
of <i>Audley End</i>, cannot admit of an easy solution; and instead
of professing to answer the two-fold query on <i>pokership</i>, it
might more become me to style this note an attempt to answer
it.</p>
<p>In the <i>Historical collections of the noble families of
Cavendishe</i>, etc. the passage which contains the doubtful word
is printed thus:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"He [Sir Robert Harley, of Bramton, Herefordshire] was in the
next year [1604], on the 16th of July, made forester of Boringwood,
<i>alias</i> Bringwood forest, in com. Hereford, with the office of
<i>pokership</i>, and custody of the forest or chace of Prestwood,
for life."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Are we to read <i>parkership</i> or <i>pokership</i>? If
<i>pokership</i>, what is its meaning?</p>
<p>Skelton, the rhymer, has <i>parker</i> for <i>park-keeper</i>,
so that <i>parkership</i> is an admissable word; but I reject it on
this occasion, as inapplicable to a forest or chace. I incline to
believe that <i>pokership</i> is the true lection. <i>Poke</i>
denoted a purse; witness Chaucer:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Gerveis answered; Certes, were it gold,</p>
<p>Or in a <i>poke</i> nobles all untold,</p>
<p>Thou shuldest it have."&mdash;C.T. v. 3777.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>We do not find <i>poker</i> in Barret or Cotgrave; but if
<i>poke</i> denoted a purse, <i>poker</i> might denote a
purse-bearer or treasurer, and <i>pokership</i>, the office of
purse-bearer. So we have BURSA, [Glossarivm manvale, 1772. I. 849.]
<i>bursar</i>, <i>bursarship</i>, etc.</p>

<h3>MERTENS, MARTINS, OR MARTINI, THE PRINTER.</h3>
<p>A correspondent, "W.," in No. 12. p. 185., wishes to learn "the
real surname of Theodoric Mertens, Martins, or Martini, the printer
of Louvain."</p>
<p>In Latin the name is written Theodoricus Martinus; in French,
Thierri Martin; in Flemish, Diedrych Meertens, and occasionally,
but I think incorrectly, Dierix Martens.</p>
<p>In a side chapel of the chancel of the church at Alost, midway
between Brussels and Ghent, is the printer's tomb, and a double
inscription, in Latin and in Flemish, commemorates his celebrity
and the dates of his birth and death; in the Latin inscription the
name is Theodoricus Martinus; in the Flemish, which is very old and
nearly effaced, it is Diedrych Meertens.</p>
<p>The name of <i>Meertens</i>, as a surname, is as common in
Brabant and Flanders as that of Martin with us.</p>
<p class="author">A.B.</p>
<hr />
<p>I beg to say that, in Peignot's <i>Dictionnaire raisonn&eacute;
de Bibliologie</i>, the name of the printer Mertens is given as
"Martens, Mertens, ou Martin d'Alost (Thierry), en Latin
Theodoricus Martinus." The article is too long for insertion in
your pages, but it contains an account of the title-page of one of
his editions, in 4to., in which the name is spelt
<i>Mertens</i>:&mdash;"Theo. Mertens impressore." Two other
title-pages have "Apud Theod. M<i>a</i>rtinum." So it appears that
the printer himself used different modes of spelling his own name.
Erasmus wrote a Latin epitaph on his friend, in which a graceful
allusion is made to his printer's mark, the anchor:&mdash;</p>

<h3>ETYMOLOGY OF ARMAGH.</h3>
<p>In reply to the inquiry of "D.S.Y." (p. 158. of your 10th
number), I beg to say that the name of Armagh is written, in Irish,
Ardmacha, and signifies the Height (or high ground) of Macha. It is
supposed to have derived this name from Macha Mong-ruadh
[<i>i.e.</i> Macha of the red hair], who was queen of Ireland,
according to the Chronology of O'Flaherty, A.M. 3603.</p>
<p class="author">I.H.T.</p>
<p>Dublin, Jan. 5. 1850.</p>
<p>Sir,&mdash;There are the following authorities for different
derivations of the word <i>Armagh</i>.</p>
<p>Camden, in his <i>Britannia</i>, says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<i>Armach</i> ab Amarch&acirc; regin&acirc;; sic dictum
fabulantur Hibernici; at mihi eadem esse videtur quam
<i>Dearmach</i> vocat Beda: et <i>Roborum Campum</i> ex lingua
Scotica sive Hibernica interpretatur, ubi circa annum salutis DLX.
monaterium extruxit celeberrimum Columbanus."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dr. Keating's <i>Hist. of Ireland</i> has as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<i>Macha</i> the wife of Nemedius died before her son Ainnim
... from her <i>Ardmagh</i> received its name, because she was
buried in that place."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>Circles of Gomer</i> (London, 1771), contains as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Ar, and Ararat.&mdash;The Earth, country, or upon and on the
earth ... <i>Armagh</i> on the surrounding water confines."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>M. Bullet, <i>M&eacute;moires de la Langue Celtique</i>, writes
thus:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Armagh, Une des plus anciennes villes d'Irland. <i>Ar</i>,
article. <i>Mag</i>, ville."&mdash;vol. i.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But the 2nd and 3rd vols. of these <i>M&eacute;moires</i>, which
contain the Celtic Dictionary, afford a more probable
interpretation:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<i>Ar</i> or <i>Ard</i> signifies a height, mountain, hill,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page219" id=
"page219"></a>{219}</span> elevation, the highest, noble, chief,
&amp;c. &amp;c., and <i>Ar</i> in Hebrew, Chaldean, and Armenian,
has the same meaning. <i>Magh</i> is a field, a plain, ground,
&amp;c., as well as a town, dwelling, &amp;c."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, the topographical description of the county of Armarh is
that it is <i>hilly</i>, and the hills (not very high) are of
granite rock. The town of Armagh again is described as situated on
an <i>eminence</i>. I suggest, therefore, <i>the high field</i> or
ground, or <i>the field of the Hill</i>, or the dwelling or town of
the Hill, as very natural derivations.</p>
<p>If your correspondent prefers it, <i>Ar</i> bears also the
signification of <i>rock</i>, and M. Bullet says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Ce terme nous a &eacute;t&eacute; conserv&eacute; dans la Vie
de Saint Colomb."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Who knows, therefore, whether in building the monastery alluded
to by Camden, he may not have given it the name of</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>The dwelling of the Rock?</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The Celtic language affords many other possibilities, but an
accurate knowledge of the locality is requisite in judging of their
probablility.</p>
<p class="author">HERMES.</p>
<p>The etymology of <i>Armagh</i>, in Ireland, is very simple.
<i>Ard</i>, high, great, noble, a purely Celtic root, found in many
languages. Latin, <i>Arduus</i>, high, &amp;c. Welsh, <i>hardh</i>,
fair, handsome, &amp;c. <i>Magh</i>, a plain, a level tract of
land, a field. <i>Ardmugh</i>, the great plain. Others derive it
from <i>Eamhuin-magh</i>, from the regal residence of the kings of
Ulster, that stood in its vicinity; but the former is considered by
those best capable of judging as the most correct. The original
name was <i>Druim-sailech</i>, "the hill of sallows," which was
changed to <i>Ard-sailech</i>, "the height of sallows," and then
again to <i>Ardmagh</i>. Although now spelt <i>Armagh</i>, it was
formerly more correctly written <i>Ardmagh</i>, which is
undoubtedly the proper way.</p>

<h3>THE OFFICE OF THE MASTER OF THE REVELS.</h3>
<p>Your esteemed correspondent, "J.G.N.," asks (p. 158.) for the
meaning of the letters "C.K.M.R." and "T.S." appended to the
passage he quotes from the <i>Common-place Book</i> of Charles,
Duke of Dorset. I think I can tell him. "C.K.M.R." stands for
<i>Charles Killegrew</i>, Master of the Revells; and "T.S." means
<i>Thomas Skipwith</i>, one of the patentees of Drury Lane Theatre,
who died in 1710. Sir Henry Herbert died in 1673; and his successor
in the office was Thomas Killegrew. This person had previously been
Sir Henry's deputy; and I am in possession of a curious list of MS.
instructions, "the heads of what I gave to Mr. Thos. Killegrew the
29th of March, 1664," in the hand-writing of Sir Henry Herbert.
Thomas Killegrew died in 1683, and was succeeded by Charles
Killegrew; the degree of the relationship between the two
Killegrews I do not know; and in the <i>London Gazette</i>, Dec. 7.
1685, there is a notice commanding all "rope-dancers,
prize-players, strollers and other persons showing motions and
other sights, to have licenses from Charles Killegrew, Esq., Master
of the Revells."</p>
<p>Charles Killegrew was one of the managers of Drury Lane Theatre
at the time of the union of the King's and Duke of York's servants;
and Drydaen calls him, in the Dedication to his translation of
Juvenal's <i>Satires</i>, his "ingenious friend."</p>
<p>Upon the death of the latter, in 1725, Charles Henry Lee
succeeded to the vacant office; who, dying in 1744, Solomon
Dayrolle was appointed in his room. I do not know the date of the
decease of the last-named gentleman; but with him, I believe, died
the office of the Master of the Revells. The ancient jurisdiction
of the Master of the Revells has been transferred, by 1737, by
legal authority, to a "licenser of the stage," who, in conjunction
with a deputy licenser, performed all the functions of the ancient
office.</p>

<h3>REPLIES TO MINOR QUERIES.</h3>
<p><i>The Red Maids of Bristol.</i>&mdash;The answer to the query
of "MR. A. GRIFFENHOOF" (No. 12. p. 184.), why the "Red Maids" in
Bristol are so called, is, because they are dressed in bright
scarlet gowns. They are the incumbents of a benevolent school,
founded in 1627, by one of Bristol's great benefactors, Alderman
Whitson, of pious memory, for the maintenance and education of 40
girls, which number has now increased to 120. Your correspondent's
curiousity respecting their name might be fully satisfied, and his
interest increased, if he should happen to be in Bristol on some
sunny afternoon in the later part of May, or the beginning of June,
by a sight of this bright "regiment of women"&mdash;the gay colour
of their gowns subdued by the quaintness of their fashion, and the
clean whiteness of their aprons, collars, &amp;c.&mdash;proceeding,
in double file, towards the downs, for air and recreation. An
account of their foundation may be found in Barret's <i>Hist. of
Bristol</i>, p. 415. "Blue-Boys," so called for a similar reason,
are a parallel case of much more general occurance. Yours,

been published by Stace, or (having ascertained that fact) to
procure further information as to the publisher. I cannot find any
allusion to the work in the <i>Censura Literuria</i>, (2nd ed.
1815), another instance of the absolute necessity for exact
references, the want of which you would do well in making a ground
of exclusion from your columns. However, on the chance of being

me, of the date of 1806, I find "Duke Shore Stairs," not far from
the great turn of the river southward, opposite to the Isle of
Dogs. Whether the proper spelling to be Dick, Dyke, Dock, Dog, or
Duke, I leave to your readers to determine; but I presume there can
be no doubt as to the identity of the place. As the origin of the
name of "Isle of Doggs," according to the Pepysian orthography, is
said to be still underdetermined; may it not be connected with the
modern term DOCKS? We are daily familiarised to worse corruptions.

<p><i>Sanuto.</i>&mdash;The <i>Ragguagli sulla Vita e sulle Opere

Mr. Rawdon Browne, an English gentleman long resident at Venice,
and a most accomplished Italian scholar. The <i>Diary of Sanuto</i>
could hardly be printed, filling, as it does, some twenty or thirty
thick large folio volumes.</p>

<p><i>Darnley's Birth-place.</i>&mdash;In answer to the inquiry in
No. 8., p. 123., as to the birth-place of Henry Lord Darnley, I
believe he was born at Temple-Newsom, near Leeds, the seat of the
Lords Irvine, and now of Meynell Ingram, Esq. A noble room is there
shown as the traditional scene of his birth.</p>

<p><i>History of Edward II.</i>&mdash;The compilers of the
<i>British Museum Catalogue</i> attribute the <i>History of Edward

published a <i>Narration of the Memorable Parliament of 1386</i>,
which has been several times printed.</p>
<p class="author">J.R.S.</p>
<p><i>Lord Chatham's Speech on the American Stamp
Act.</i>&mdash;When I read the question of your correspondent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page221" id=
"page221"></a>{221}</span> (in No. 1. p. 12.) on this subject, I
saw at once its importance; for, if my Lord Brougham's statements
were correct, our historians must forthwith re-write a somewhat
important chapter in our history. I felt assured, however, that it
was not correct; and the result of a somewhat tedious search is as
I had anticipated. His lordship had made an error in a date and
1764 should be 1766. The authority, not acknowledged by his
lordship, was, no doubt, the <i>Parliamentary History of</i> 1766
(vol. xvi. p. 96.), where your correspondent will find the
statement, which of course, the date being correctly given,
contains nothing that is not consistent with known facts.</p>
<p class="author">C.</p>
<p><i>Bone-houses.</i>&mdash;The number of skulls at Rothewell (No.
11., p. 171.) is greatly exaggerated, nor is the tradition of their
being gathered from Naseby battle-field more than a modern
invention, the discovery of the bones being within the memory of
living persons. Their existence there is most puzzling. The vault,
which is very small, is probably coeval with the church, and seems
to have been made for the very purpose to which it is applied. When
this vast building was erected in the 12th century, may not this
vault have been made for the bones disturbed in the old churchyard
by so extensive a foundation?</p>
<p class="author">T.</p>
<p><i>Queen's Messengers.</i>&mdash;In answer to the query of your
correspondent "J.U.G.G.," in No. 12., p. 186., I beg to call his
attention to the authority quoted in the passage respecting the
"Knightes caligate of Armes," to which he alludes, in Mr. C.
Knight's <i>London</i>. He will find that he is referred to Legh's
<i>Accedens of Armory</i>, and Upton, <i>De Studio Militari</i>.
The latter wrote in the early part of the fifteenth century. We are
at present, I believe, without earlier information on such
subjects.</p>
<p>Whilst I am writing to you, may I ask you to correct a printer's
error in my query in the same number, where "trepon" appears
instead of "jupon"? It may save a query as to what I could mean by
the former.</p>

<p><i>May-day.</i>&mdash;In reply to MELANION (No. 12. p. 187.), I
would observe that in a collection of <i>Vues des Villes de
Londres</i>, &amp;c., published by Pierre Vander at Leyden (without
date, but about the time of William III., or early in Anne's
reign), there is a representation of "<i>La Laiti&egrave;re de May
&agrave; Londres</i>," with an enormous head-dress of silver
dishes, tankards, and cups, intermixed with flowers. There is no
letter-press explanation; but it is evident that the practice of
the milk-maids, in carrying their mail-pails balanced on their
heads, suggested the idea of carrying this more precious burthen in
<i>gala</i> on May-day.</p>

<h2>MISCELLANIES.</h2>
<p><i>Gray's Elegy.</i>&mdash;Your correspondent, "A. GRAYAN" (No.
10., p. 150.), in writing on the <i>Elegy in a Country
Church-yard</i>, suggests the existence of error or obscurity in
the last stanza of the epitaph; and that, if the reading, as it now
stand, be faulty, "some amendment" should be suggested.</p>
<p>At the sale of Mason's collection of Gray's books and MSS., in
December, 1845, I purchased Gray's copy of Dodsley's collection
(2nd edition, 1758), with corrections, names of authors, &amp;c.,
in his own hand. The <i>Elegy</i> is the first poem in vol. iv. In
the 2nd stanza, the beetle's "<i>drony</i> flight" is printed and
corrected in the margin into "droning." In the 25th stanza, an
obvious misprint of "the upland land" is corrected into "upland
lawn;" and, in the 27th stanza, "he would rove" is altered into
"would he rove." These are the only emendations in the
<i>Elegy</i>. The care displayed in marking them seems to me
indicate that the author had no others to insert, and that the
common reading is as he finally left it.</p>
<p>To say that a man's merits and frailties repose in trembling
hope before God, is surely not irreverent; and this is, I think,
all that Gray intended to convey in the words to which your
correspondent objects.</p>
<p class="author">W.L.M.</p>
<p class="note">[The latter emendation "would he rove," which is
neither in the Aldine edition of the Rev. J. Mitford, nor in Mr.
Van Voorst's beautifully illustrated Polyglot edition, should
clearly be introduced, in future, as harmonising more perfectly
with the "would he stretch" of the preceding stanza.]</p>
<p><i>Gray's Elegy.</i>&mdash;To the list of German translations of
Gray's Elegy should be added the version by Kosegarten, which is
said by Mr. Thimm, in his <i>View of German Literature</i>, to be
"very spirited." The edition of Kosegarten i have now before me was
printed at Greifswald, in 12 vols. in 1824, and contains numerous
translations from English poets.</p>
<p class="author">J.M.</p>
<p>Oxford, Jan. 16.</p>
<p><i>Gregori's Italian Version of "Gray's Elegy."</i>&mdash;In
answer to the query of "J.F.M.," respecting the translations of
Gray's <i>Elegy</i>, I beg to mention that, besides those already
possessed by your correspondent, and those in Torri's polyglot
edition, there is one in Italian by Domenico Gregori, published in
the first volume of his <i>Scelta di Poesie di pi&ugrave; celebri
Autori Inglesi, recati in Versi Italiani</i>, and printed at Rome
in 1821, in 2 vols. small 8vo.</p>
<p class="author">M.</p>
<p>Oxford, Jan. 17. 1850.</p>
<p><i>Name of Shylock.</i>&mdash;When Mr. Knight says that
<i>Scialac</i> was "the name of a Marionite (Maronite?) of mount
Libanus," he appears to consider the <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page222" id="page222"></a>{222}</span> term peculiar, or nearly
so, to that personage; but Upton, as long ago as 1748, in his
<i>Critical Observations</i>, 2nd ed. p. 299., remarked, that
<i>Scialac</i> was the generic name, and <i>Shylock</i> merely a
corruption. I may also remark, that Mr. Knight dismisses Dr.
Farmer's theory as worthless, without sufficient consideration. It
by no means follows that 1607 is the date of the <i>first
edition</i> of <i>Caleb Shillocke</i>, merely because Boswell saw a
copy bearing that date.</p>

<p><i>By Hook or by Crook.</i>&mdash;It is said that Strongbow,
when debating with his followers on the best mode of capturing
Ireland, said, that it must be taken "by Hook or by Crook." "<i>The
Hook</i>" is the name of a well-known promontory, forming the N.E.
boundary of Waterford Harbour; and <i>Crook-haven</i> is an equally
well-known harbour, on the south coast. Could this have any thing
to do with the proverb?</p>

<p><i>Macaulay's Young Levite.</i>&mdash;I send you an
advertisement, from a local paper of 1767, which shows what stipend
was offered to a curate at that period. The population of Burton
Bradstich and Shepton Gorge, in 1821, was respectively 854 and 311.
I do not know what it was in 1767.</p>
<p>The value of the rectory of Burton, with the chapelry of
Shepton, was returned, in 1650, as 201<i>l.</i> In 1826 it was
computed to be 500<i>l.</i></p>
<p class="author">A.D.M.</p>
<p>From "Cruthwell's Sherborne, Shaftesbury, and Dorchester
Journal; or Yeovil, Taunton, and Bridgewater Chronicle of 10th
July, 1767."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"A Curate is wanted, at Old Michaelmas next, to serve the
Churches of Burton and Shipton, in Dorsetshire; Salary 36<i>l.</i>
per annum, Easter Offerings, and Surplice Fees; together with a
good House, pleasant Gardens, and a Pigeon House well stock'd. The
Churches are within a mile and a half of each other, served once a
Day, and alternately. The Village of Burton is sweetly situated,
within half a mile of the Sea, about a mile and a half from
Bridport Harbour, and is noted in the Summer for its fine Mackarel
Fishery. Application to be made to the Rev. Mr. Richards,

</div>
<p>is to be found? A long search for it has hitherto proved

<p class="author">D.S.</p>
<p class="note">[This line, which is so often quoted, with the

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Praise undeserved is <i>Satire</i> in disguise,"</p>

</div>
<p class="note">is to be found in Pope's <i>First Epistle of the

<i>Censure</i> nor <i>Satire</i> is the correct reading. It is
moreover, both in Warton's edition and in the <i>Aldine Poets</i>,
edited by the Rev. A. Dyce, marked as a quotation, as will be seen
in the following extract; so that Pope, it appears, is not the
author of it. Perhaps some of our correspondents can trace the
source from which he derived it:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">

<p>"Besides, a fate attends on all I write,</p>
<p>That when i aim at praise they say I bite.</p>

<p><i>Passage in Cowper's "Task."</i>&mdash;In all early editions

punctuated as follows:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">

<p>"Hark! 'tis the twanging horn! O'er yonder bridge,</p>

<p>He comes, the herald of a noisy world," &amp;c.</p>

corruption of the passage:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Hark! 'tis the twanging horn o'er yonder bridge,</p>

<p>closing with a colon or period at "bright," and <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page223" id="page223"></a>{223}</span> beginning

vulgar colloquialism "'tis the horn over the bridge," instead of
the remark, that the postman is coming over it.</p>

<h3>NOTES ON BOOKS, SALES, CATALOGUES, ETC.</h3>
<p>All who have placed on their shelves&mdash;and who that desires
to know thoroughly the history of this country during the period
which it illustrates has not done so&mdash;the last edition of
<i>The Diary and Correspondence of Samuel Pepys</i>, so ably edited
by Lord Braybrooke, have felt the want of a corresponding edition
of <i>Evelyn's Diary</i>. To meet this want, Mr. Coulburn has
announced a new edition of it, "rendered as complete as possible by
a careful revision," and accompanied by illustrative notes, to be
completed in four monthly volumes.</p>
<p>Mr. Parker, of Oxford, has just issued a new edition of <i>The
History of the Church of England</i>, by J.B.S. Carwithen, B.D.
This work was very highly spoken of, at the time of its first
appearance, for fidelity of narrative, accuracy of judgement, and
soundness of principle; and its author was pronounced, by one well
qualified to give an opinion, "a well-read historian, a sound
divine, a charitable Christian." As the original edition, in three
volumes, has long been out of print, we think Mr. Parker has shown
great judgment in bringing it out, in a cheaper form, for the use
of students in divinity; and we do not doubt but that he will find
a ready sale for the two closely but clearly and handsomely printed
volumes, in which this <i>History of the Church of England</i> is
now completed.</p>
<p>Those of our readers who take an interest in the writings of our
early dramatists will be glad to learn that the Rev. Alexander Dyce
has at length completed, in three volumes, his long-looked-for
edition of <i>The Dramatic Works of Kit Marlowe</i>.</p>

<p>and who must, therefore, sometimes be painfully convinced of the
ill practices which occasionally grow up in the belfry, will thank
us for calling their attention to the <i>Practical Remarks on

Ellacombe, in which they will find some useful hints for the

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
